# StackAnswers-A-Web-Forum
This project was to build an Online Forum like Quora or Stack-Overflow.
It has functionality of User Sign-Up & Login to Ask Questions and Answering Questions asked like a forum.
Additonally users can also Like (or upvotes) Answers and also comment to any answer.
I made this with extensive use of Python Django Framework, Javascript and CSS Bootstrap.

Please see screenshots attached.

Note: The Project file can be opened using the password I sent to you
